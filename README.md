# GraphQL

Learning about graphql with rails (and learning about rails at the same time). This repo is pretty much useless for people who aren't me.

If you *are* me, either...hello future me, hope you're well. You're cool! Or, you're a clone. At which point, are you from the future? Or is there a part of my life I don't know about yet? Either way, please get in touch because I'm inredibly curious.
